# Carbon-foot-print
track, reduce and act combating carbon footprint with technology which deals with calculation of current passing through the ecah household devices and inform us if there is any issue like low or high voltage power supply this project idea is taken from problem caused in real life
#problem statement
The Homes today are powered by electricity—but run inefficiently due to undetected appliance faults. Most households lack smart monitoring to catch this energy waste in real-time. Existing tools are either too generic or expensive for average users. As climate change accelerates, every unit of wasted energy adds to the crisis. There's a growing demand for accessible, AI-based energy management solutions. Our approach empowers users to track, reduce, and act on energy inefficiencies. It aligns with environmental goals while supporting household savings. This isn’t just innovation—it’s a necessity for a sustainable future. Market: Growing need for affordable smart energy tools. Society: Helps households save money and live sustainably. Industry: Supports energy efficiency and decarbonization goals.
#Teams Approach
Our solution introduces a dual-layered AI-powered platform that combines real-time data analytics with adaptive learning to deliver smart energy insights. Instead of just monitoring electricity use, the platform learns household energy behavior over time, anticipates abnormal usage patterns, and predicts potential failures before they escalate. Key features include: AI-based appliance profiling and fault prediction. Dynamic recommendations for energy-efficient usage schedules. Smart alerts integrated into a mobile/web dashboard. Optional compatibility with affordable plug-in sensors for more granular control. This hybrid approach balances precision, affordability, and ease of use, creating an intelligent assistant for sustainable and safe energy consumption at home.
#Hardwear used
Arduino uno, current sensor, resistance, capaciter, Bread Board, Arduino USB Cable
#Future Enhancements
Software AI model enhancement for broader fault types. Expansion to commercial buildings and industries. Collaboration with appliance manufacturers. Take our home energy-saving AI to factories, hospitals, and offices—stop waste, predict machine failures, and cut costs with zero extra hardware.
